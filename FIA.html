									<p><strong>Section 1A - Times:</strong> Races for each tier will be held at
										 the agreed times of 20:00 GMT on Sunday for Tier 1 and 20:00 GMT
										 on Monday for tier 2. It is advised to arrive in the
									   lobby 15 minutes early. </p>

									<p><strong>Section 1B - Settings:</strong> The lobby host(s) will be responsible
										for ensuring the event is setup correctly. This will
										typically be the commentating team streaming the session.

									</br> - <strong>1Bi</strong> - Event will consist of a short
										 qualifying session and a 50% race except
										 when explicitly stated.
									</br> - <strong>1Bi</strong> - Damage will be set to Standard/Standard.

										strict corner cutting.
									</br> - <strong>1Bviii</strong> - All drivers should choose their
										 correct car when entering the lobby.
									</br> - <strong>1Bix</strong> - Spectator spots reserved for
										commentators. Race engineers are not allowed to join the lobby even if
										there is space available.

										and additionally pit assist will be turned off. DRS and ERS assist

									<!--<QUALIFYING>-->
									<h2>Section 2:<strong>Qualifying</strong><br /></h2>
									<p><strong>Section 2A - Blocking:</strong> Drivers must pay attention to
										the other cars on track to ensure that they don’t block people on
										Hot Laps.
									</br> - <strong>2Ai</strong> - Slowing down a
										car on a Hot Lap (Blocking) is illegal and will result in a
										penalty. 1 penalty point will be awarded for a minor block that results with minor consequences.
										A quali ban and 2 penalty points will be awarded for a major block that results with major
										consequences.
									</br> - <strong>2Aii</strong> - Intentionally slowing down a
										car on an outlap will be treated like hot
										lap blocking and will result in similar
										consequence.
									</br> - <strong>2Aiii</strong> - AI are treated like a normal
										driver. If somebody’s AI blocks a flying
										lap then it will be punished Identically
										to if the driver had done it.
									</br> - <strong>2Aiv</strong> - If there is evidence provided
										which indicates that the driver did the most to avoid blocking
										but was unable to, they may be excused from standard punishment.</P>

										of the use of the circuit during Qualification is strictly prohibited.
										Drivers caught violating conventional use of the track will be
									  punished accordingly.
									</br> - <strong>2Bi</strong> - Retiring on track during any
										session is punishable, and will grant 2 penalty points. This is
									  	due to the AI taking over and potentially blocking drivers.
										Drivers that wish to manually retire must do so within the pits.
									</br> - <strong>2Bii</strong> - An intentional reitrement, such as crashing out on purpose,
										will result 4 penalty points for that driver. However, if the same driver does
										this a second time, they will be reviewed by the owners and removed from the league
										if deemed necessary.									</p>
									</br> - <strong>2Biii</strong> - Resetting to track is prohibited
										and will result in similar punishment to '2Bi', as this action
										may respawn drivers in the way of others. However, if they are
										stuck on the curbs, they are excused from punishment as long as
										they do not disrupt the flow of track use.
									</br> - <strong>2Biv</strong> - Drivers must take every
										corner, as they would in a normal lap, ignoring this
										will result in a Qualification Ban, due to the blatent
										issue of distracting others from their laps and potential
										damage to circuit markers.					 </p>

									<p><strong>Section 2C - Qualifaction Bans:</strong> A driver may recieve
										a qualifying ban as punishment for rules violations.
									</br> - <strong>2Ci</strong> - A driver serving a qualifying may exit the pit lane 
										and do 1 outlap to confirm their setup. This should be done as soon as possible.
										The driver must then return to the pits and retire the car asap. If drivers wait some
										time to do an outlap (for e.g. half way through quali), they will be given 2 penalty points.
									</br> - <strong>2Cii</strong> - A driver serving
	 									a qualifying ban may not cross the line to start a lap.
	 									If they are caught doing so, the ban will carry over to the next Grand Prix.   </p>

									<h2>Section 3:<strong>Session Start & Formation Lap</strong><br /></h2>
								  <p><strong>Section 3A - Readying Up:</strong> Each event will have
										a ready up time announced (BST) within the league discord.
										Any driver which starts the session prematurely
										will be given 3 Penalty Points as this effects
										other drivers preperation time. </p>

									<p><strong>Section 3B - Formation Lap:</strong> Drivers are expected to drive
										safely as they would in a race.
									</br> - <strong>3Bi</strong> - 10 Car lengths maximum must
										be left between 2 cars on a formation lap.
									</br> - <strong>3Bii</strong> - Collisions made with another car(s)
									  will result in a penalty decided by the FIA.</p>

									<p><strong>Section 3C - Jumped Start:</strong> When Drivers have an AI jump start,
										they must return to their Grid starting position by the end of lap 1,
										failure to do so will result in disqualfication from the Grand Prix.
										Exclusion from this will only apply if that position is no longer available.
										This is to also be applied for when the Driver jumps the start.
									</br> - <strong>3Ci</strong> - If a driver uses the AI for race start, the driver will

										sufficiently handed back.
								  </br> - <strong>4Biv</strong> - Video provided to the FIA clearly
										showing the race director screen and the incident in its entirety. The race director

									  punished for forcing another car off track, provided the following
								  	conditions are met:

									</br> - <strong>4Hi</strong> - Drivers may only make one movement
										into a braking zone and must not move under braking.

									</br> --- <strong>4Hiiγ</strong> - Resulting contact causes both drivers to lose
									  out to a third party.
									</br> - <strong>4Hiii</strong> - Drivers may move under braking if they are
									  letting cars by due to damage, blue flags, or team orders. </p>

									<p><strong>Section 4I - Weaving:</strong> Weaving on the straight is only acceptable

									  it will result in a 5 second time penalty and 2 penalty points.  </p>

									<p><strong>Section 4J - Blue Flags:</strong> Unless the driver about to be lapped has
										sufficient pace to stay ahead, they should be prepared to let the lapping car through
										safely and swiftly with minimal consequence, such as lost delta. Blue flagged cars must

									</br> - <strong>5Biii</strong> - For every place gained illegally the driver
										will be awarded a 5 second penalty unless the place is given back within 1 lap.
									</br> - <strong>5Biv</strong> - Illegal overtaking also	includes gaining
									  	positions through desync.

										will be followed depending on the circumstance
										There will be a 35% race to complete the GP.
										Starting grid will be decided 1 lap before the Red
										Flag has been waved. For example, when the Red Flag
										has been waved at Lap 7, the grid order will be from Lap 6;
										If decided by the Owners, the race may be
										voided and no points will be given.  </p>

			 								on driver development by the Owners to determine whether their
											progression will warrant a promotion.

									</br><strong>Section 9Bii</strong>: Similarly, drivers in Tier 1 will also be analysed to determine
										if the skill they present warrants a relegation to Tier 2.</p>

									<p><strong>Section 9C</strong>: Promotions will be given based off an owners discussion.
											This may occur due to drivers being too fast for that tier.
